Can we scrape data from any website?


No my friend...this is not possible with every website as some of the popular websites have defense intelligence robots(a piece of code) to check who are trying to visit and scrape data
from the website. To avoid this we have to change User Agents when we scrape the same website for more number of times or we scrape some high security websites.

Now...what is a User Agent? 
A User Agent is a "string" which is used to tell the server what kind of  a browser,what version and what device the request is coming from. So we can fool the server/robot
by mentioning another User Agent in our url.
